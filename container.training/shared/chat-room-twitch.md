## Use the chat!

- We have set up a chat room on @@CHAT@@

  (clicking the link above will take you to the chat room)

- Don't hesitate to use it to ask questions, or get help, or share feedback

- We will *not* use the Twitch chat room for Q&A

  (nothing wrong with it, but Gitter is more convenient for code snippets etc.)

- Feel free to ask questions at any time

- Sometimes we will wait a bit to answer ...

  ... but don't worry, we'll make sure to address all your questions!

## Use non-verbal communication cues

- ... wait, what?!?

--

- In the chat room, you are welcome (even encouraged!) to use emojis!

- Some of our favorites:

  .emoji[🤔✔️👍🏻👍🏼👍🏽👍🏾👍🏿⚠️🛑]

- During the session, we'll often ask audience participation questions

- Feel free to answer in the chat room, any way you like!

  (short message, emoji reaction ...)
